        <h2>Major take-aways</h2>
        <p>To conclude, I feel that Consumers are now the King. A consumer have several rights and duties and carry authority to complain whatever is going wrong. Initially Consumers were exploited and they could not ask for justice. The consumers were generally not aware of their rights and "duties. This allows, the producers to cheat the consumers and gain profit. Now, the government is doing it's best to empower consumers through various measures like Consumer courts, Security value etc. Consumers Should have Knowledge about certified products, Check MRP, date of manufacturing, and expiry at the time of purchase of a commodity. They must have awareness about their rights and duties. There is no doubt that consumer awareness is quite more in the present time and has helped a lot in bringing the transformation.
